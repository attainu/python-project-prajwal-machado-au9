_Introduction:_
Folders and files need to be organised so that while searching files or folders it is easily found without toggling into the search bar and searching for a specific extension file.

_Motivation:_
It is often observed that the Document or the Downloads folder of the computer are highly unorganised with all kinds of files in a single folder. This program is a target for people with mostly unorganised Files in a folder. The main aim of this program is to organise the files according to users preference.

So this program mainly aims at a Python script which organises the folders based on the extension,size and modified time using the Command Line Interface.

_Libraries and Modules Used:_
Argparse
OS
Stat
Datetime
Shutil

_Refernces_
Python Documentation
Automate the Boring Stuff

_Future Scope:_
The application can be integrated with the GUI so that the file can be organised by a single click with the help of a desktop application.
The code can be integrated and made used to return back to initial state before the organisation of the files.
