# Introduction:

_Folders and files need to be organised so that while searching files or folders it is easily found without toggling into the search bar and searching for a specific extension file._

# Motivation:

_It is often observed that the Document or the Downloads folder of the computer are highly unorganised with all kinds of files in a single folder. This program is a target for people with mostly unorganised Files in a folder. The main aim of this program is to organise the files according to users preference._

_So this program mainly aims at a Python script which organises the folders based on the extension,size and modified time using the Command Line Interface._

# Libraries and Modules Used:

_Argparse_
_OS_
_Stat_
_Datetime_
_Shutil_

# Refernces

_Python Documentation_
_Automate the Boring Stuff_

# Future Scope

_The application can be integrated with the GUI so that the file can be organised by a single click with the help of a desktop application._
_The code can be integrated and made used to return back to initial state before the organisation of the files._
