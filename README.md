#Introduction:
_Folders and files need to be organised so that while searching files or folders it is easily found without toggling into the search bar and searching for a specific extension file._

#Motivation:
\*It is often observed that the Document or the Downloads folder of the computer are highly unorganised with all kinds of files in a single folder. This program is a target for people with mostly unorganised Files in a folder. The main aim of this program is to organise the files according to users preference.

So this program mainly aims at a Python script which organises the folders based on the extension,size and modified time using the Command Line Interface.\*

#Libraries and Modules Used:
_Argparse
OS
Stat
Datetime
Shutil_

#Refernces
Python Documentation
Automate the Boring Stuff

#Future Scope:
_The application can be integrated with the GUI so that the file can be organised by a single click with the help of a desktop application.
The code can be integrated and made used to return back to initial state before the organisation of the files._
